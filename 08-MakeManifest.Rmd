# Use RStudio to assign each image to the proper camera trap "event" and to create the Zooniverse manifest


Within the RStudio project, navigate to **Code > PreZooniverse** and open the file called **PreZooniversePrep.Rmd.** Step through this file, making sure to establish the proper directory paths and input file names. If all of the code runs successfully, you will have created a manifest file that will be located in **Output > PreZooniverse > Manifests**. An intermediate file will also be saved to **Output > PreZooniverse > ImagesByEvent**.

## Copy the manifest file to the correct location on the t:// drive

Navigate to the Files pane in RStudio and to the folder containing the manifest file you just created. Check the box next to the manifest file you wish to copy (there may be several in this folder). Choose the
"More" button at the top of the Files pane and select "Copy to"
(Figure 8.1).

(ref:fig8-1) Moving the manifest to the t:// drive.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig8-1, fig.cap = '(ref:fig8-1)'}
#add figure 1 and a text reference as its caption
knitr::include_graphics("images/fig8.1.CopyToManifests.jpg") #figure
```

A dialog box will open.

Navigate to t://Bart_s04/Research_group/NoCoWild/Zooniverse/Manifests and save the file there, keeping the file name the same. Note that you will need an active connection to the t:drive for this to work.
