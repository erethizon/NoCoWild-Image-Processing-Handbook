For many students, this will be the most confusing part of the process, so please read the instructions carefully. 5.2 Python Scripts Notice the expanded folder called North-Country-Wild in figure 5.1. It contains the PythonScripts folder that you will need to access to run our scripts. Brett has created a python script called upload_and_process_images.py located in the folder called PythonScripts inside of th North-Country-Wild folder in the root directory of the NoCoWild hard drive (figure 5.1). The other two scripts in the folder are used for pushing files to the zooniverse once they are processed. Figure 5.1: Python Script files inside of the PythonScripts folder To use the script you will need to: Open a terminal window (See “Accessing the terminal” in Chapter 3 for a refresher). From the terminal, cd into the PythonScripts folder by dragging the folder icon onto the terminal after typing cd on the command line To access the script and learn about its subcommands, type python3 upload_and_process_images.py -h. Text with information about the script subcommands will display in the terminal window because you added -h after the name of the script (figure 5.2). Figure 5.2: Terminal window showing location in PythonScripts folder and subcommands for the upload_and_process_images.py script 5.3 Script subcommands You can see that there are three possible subcommands, each of which take several different arguments (Table 4.1). Table 4.1 shows the list of script subcommands and their arguments Subcommand Arguments change_file_size_and_copyright This subcommand takes as arguments the path to the processed images which have already been renamed, and resizes them and adds copyright information. copy_raw_images_change_file_size_and_copyright This subcommand takes as arguments the camera number and sd card number, each as three-digit integers, and copies, resizes, and adds copyright information to the images; if a three digit integer is not provided, the script will automatically add leading zeros completely_process_images_from_sd_card This subcommand takes a number of different arguments (use -h after the subcommand to see them) and completely process images from the sd card to separate directories (aka “folders”) for the raw and processed images 5.4 Running the Scripts Before you can begin using the scripts to process image files, you need to create empty folders for the camera-sd card combination in the Raw and Processed folders for the given year. 5.4.1 Completely process images from sd card 5.4.2 Copy raw images change file size and copyright 5.4.3 Change file size and copyright 5.5 Summary The “terminal” interface is one of the main ways we will run the tools we need for managing our images. You should become comfortable working with the terminal in order to proceed with the next chapters.
