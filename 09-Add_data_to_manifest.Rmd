# Add any additional data to the manifest file


This required step is done using Excel to add any added metadata to the
manifest that you would like to be associated with the images. This step
must be done before pushing images to the Zooniverse. Talk with Erika
about whether you will be adding metadata to the manifest.

## Copy the manifest file (again) to the correct location on the external hard drive.

We store a copy of the manifest file on the t:drive because it is
automatically backed up. However, to upload the manifest to Zooniverse,
it needs to be located in the folder of images we intend to upload. For
that reason, copy the manifest file you just created on the t:drive and
navigate to the folder of images you plan to upload, located on the
external hard drive. Paste the manifest file into the folder of images.

**The only things in this folder should be the actual image files and
the manifest.**
