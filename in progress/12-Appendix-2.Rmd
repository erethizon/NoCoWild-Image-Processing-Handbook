# Appendix 2 - Some Terminal Tricks

## Counting the number of files in a directory using Terminal

We can use the terminal to make quick work of some tasks that take a long time.

For example, what if you want to count all of the image files in a folder?

Using terminal, we might do the following:

1.  cd to the directory you wish to count
2.  type `find . -not -type d | egrep -v '\.jpg$' | wc -l` at the command line.

The `-not -type d` excludes directories but would find symlinks and other non-regular files;
change it to `-type f` to only find regular files.
