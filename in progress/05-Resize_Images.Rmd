# Resize images for upload to Zooniverse via ImageMagick

The Zooniverse sets a maximum image size of 1MB. Our cameras take higher
resolution pictures, generally in the realm of 3.5MB. Thus, we would
like to batch resize the photos for upload to the Zooniverse. To do so,
we use another command-line software called ImageMagick.

We have installed ImageMagick on the iMac in the lab. However, if you
wish to install it on your own mac, see Appendix 1. Additional Details
and code snippets, for instructions on how to install "Homebrew", a
package manager for the Mac, and then use Homebrew to install
imagemagick.

## Resizing images

With imagemagick installed, move to the directory with the set of images
you wish to resize and type the following line of code in the terminal:

\$magick mogrify -resize "2000>" --define jpeg:extent=900kb \*.JPG

Note that the .JPG is case-sensitive. If the images are labeled .jpg,
then type that instead.

This line of code basically says "Turn on imagemagick and use it to
resize photos. Their maximum width or height (whichever is larger) will
be 2000 pixels. Next define their final size as 900kb. Do this for all
of the images (the \*.JPG where \* is a wildcard) in the folder.

Note: Resizing takes a long time. For example, to run about 4000 photos
took 1hr and 10 minutes.
