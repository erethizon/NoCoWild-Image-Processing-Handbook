# Use RStudio to assign each image to the proper camera trap "event" and to create the Zooniverse manifest


Within the RStudio project, navigate to Code -\> PreZooniverse -\> and
open the file called PreZooniversePrep.Rmd. Step through this file,
making sure to establish the proper directory paths and input file
names. If all of the code runs successfully, you will have created a
manifest file that will be located in Output -\> PreZooniverse -\>
Manifests. An intermediate file will also be saved to Output -\>
PreZooniverse -\> ImagesByEvent.

## Copy the manifest file to the correct location on the t:// drive

Navigate to the Files pane in RStudio and to the folder containing the
manifest file you just created. Check the box next to the manifest file
you wish to copy (there may be several in this folder). Choose the
\"More\" button at the top of the Files pane and select \"Copy to\"
(Figure 15).

t:drive.

A dialog box will open.

Navigate to t://Bart_s04/Research_group/NoCoWild/Zooniverse/Manifests
and save the file there, keeping the file name the same. Note that you
will need an active connection to the t:drive for this to work.
