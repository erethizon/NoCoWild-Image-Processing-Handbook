# Upload manifest and images to Zooniverse via Panoptes


The Zooniverse platform allows you to upload images for processing by
drag-and-drop. This works fine for up to several hundred images, but is
problematic when you have more images. As a result, we use a
command-line method to upload our files to the Zooniverse.

To upload images at once, we install and use the "[Panoptes Command Line
Interface](https://github.com/zooniverse/panoptes-cli#installation)"
from the Zooniverse. Instructions are provided at the Panoptes
hyperlink. However, the instructions are not quite up to date. Using
python version 3, you need to change some of the text to python3 and
pip3.

However, once you have the panoptes client installed, uploading is very
straightforward.

First, create an empty subject set in your Zooniverse project. Name it
something useful. For example, "2021 Round 1 images". **Do not upload a
manifest or any images to the subject set.** See Figure 16 for details.

Look near the top of the page to find the unique number that the
Zooniverse assigns to your subject set. You will need to use this number
in the command-line, so write it down. In our example (Figure 16) the
unique number for Round 1 Batch 2 is #73895.

Once you have the number written down, go to your terminal interface.
Navigate to the folder containing the images you wish to upload and the
manifest for those images. These are the only things that should be in
that folder, and you should have BOTH images and the manifest before you
do the upload.

Now, type the following into the command line:

> \$ panoptes subject-set upload-subjects 73895 manifest.csv

But change the number to whatever the subject set number is that you
wrote down and change manifest.csv to whatever the name of the manifest
file is (but make sure it ends with .csv).

Panoptes may throw a warning message, something like "Broken libmagic
installation detected...." but just ignore that warning. You'll see
something like Figure 17 as the computer works to upload the images.
Depending on how many images are in the folder, this step could take
more than an hour to complete. Do not use the iMac for anything else
while this process takes place.
